# CSS

## What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. Using CSS you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more.

## Why use CSS?
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout, and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

## CSS Syntax
A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:
* selector - h1
* declaration block - {color: blue; font-size: 12px;}
The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. 

## Style Selectors
* Universal Selector: The universal selector (*) selects all the elements on a page.
* Type Selector: The type selector selects all the elements that have the given type.
* Grouping Selector: The grouping selector selects all the elements that have the given type.
* Class Selector: The class selector selects all the elements that have the given class attribute.
* ID Selector: The ID selector selects an element based on the value of its id attribute.
